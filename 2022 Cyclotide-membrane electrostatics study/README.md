# Cyclotide/Membrane Electrostatics Study (2022)

This folder contains MFsim job input definitions for cyclotide/membrane interaction and pure water simulations with different electrostatics settings in ZIP file *Cyclotide-membrane electrostatics.zip*. The ZIP file comprises a MFsim workspace folder *Cyclotide-membrane electrostatics* with a *JobInputs*/*JobResults* subfolder pair.

To view or (re)use the job input definitions, download and extract the contents of ZIP file *Cyclotide-membrane electrostatics.zip* to a desired location and set the MFsim workspace preference *Preferences/Directories/MFsim workspace* via MFsim menu entry *Application/Preferences/Edit* accordingly (a MFsim workspace directory is the folder directly above a *JobInputs*/*JobResults* subfolder pair).

The study is described in the scientific literature (the final manuscript *2022 - Baensch - Cyc-Mem Electrostatics - Final Manuscript.pdf* is also provided within this folder):
