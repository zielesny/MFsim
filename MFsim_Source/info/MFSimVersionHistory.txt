--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed problems:
  - A severe error in methods readParticlePositions() and 
    readMoleculeParticlePositions() of class JobUtilityMethods is removed which
    affected particle distance or radial distribution calculations.
  - Radius of gyration values are now correctly reported in Angstrom (and not in
    DPD units).
  - A rare but severe error concerning molecular concentration settings during 
    job design is removed.
  - An internal error in class GraphicsUtilityMethods is removed which could 
    prevent the proper construction of a simulation box start geometry.
  - An internal error that could disable the job execution tab during job
    execution is removed.
  - Zoom for distribution movies is removed due to an too intricate logic. Zoom
    values of corresponding frequency distribution diagrams are still obeyed for 
    distribution movie generation.
  - Job execution tab is now correctly switched to job design tab if there is no
    job for execution.
  - A Job Input / Job Result with proteins/peptides may now be viewed without any
    dependence on the current particle set (before, the current particle set had
    to contain amino acid definitions for a proper view without exceptions).

- Improvements:
  - Integration of Jdpd 1.4.0.0 with extended random number generators (Apache
    Commons RNG version 1.3 where jumpable random number generators are 
    especially exploited for successive random number generator creation) and 
    extended harmonic bond behaviour (DEFAULT, ATTRACTIVE, REPULSIVE) for 
    molecule and protein backbone forces.
  - The reference temperature is changed from 298 K to 300 K for consistency.
  - The "Particles" menu is reorganized and improved. A new method for rescale
    of the repulsions a(ij) of a particle set is added. The duplication method 
    for particles is enhanced to allow for a proper change of charge for the 
    duplicated particle (note, that use of this method may require a full 
    repulsions a(ij) rescale to avoid ill-defined settings if duplication is
    performed with a charge-change).
  - New rescaled and corrected particle set "ParticleSet_AA_V03.txt" is 
    included (the diagonal a(ij) values for charged particles are not correct 
    in "ParticleSet_AA_V02.txt" and "ParticleSet_AA_V01.txt").
  - Minor improvements concerning descriptions and minor corrections are 
    implemented.
  - Tool tip text for job result filter is corrected.
  - Volume scaling for concentration calculations becomes a preference 
    (Preferences/Edit/Miscellaneous/Volume scaling). The default is "Volume 
    scaling for concentration calculations".
  - Particle set creation with a morphed particle is implemented where the 
    repulsion parameters a(ij) of a source particle are changed towards a target
    particle according to a specified percentage between 0 and 100%.
  - Scaling of repulsion parameters a(ij) may now be performed with an individual
    scaling factor for each temperature (already implemented in previous version)
    or with a global scaling factor for all temperatures (new in this version).
  - Each Job Input now contains an individual random seed value definition for 
    geometry calculations which affects the particle positions in the simulation 
    box. (Old) Job inputs are automatically updated for compatibility with the 
    default random seed value of 1L if necessary.

- Internal improvements:
  - Deprecated finalize methods, deprecated Double constructor and deprecated
    ShouldYieldFocus method are removed.
